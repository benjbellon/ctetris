* Feature and Mechanic Ideas
Various ideas for mechanics which add fun and a new degree of difficulty in development.

** Mino "Creatures"
Each Mino contains a small "thing" which can affect game play. Maybe:
- a bullet that breaks out after some time shaking around
- a magnet that pulls it faster towards similar minos.
- explodes the tetromino and allows you to rotate a fragemented tetromino in a larger bounding box...
- A creature that breaks out, eats certain color bricks and poops out a different color
- A create that makes the tetromino go sideways and stick to the wall, until eventually it drops randomly..

** Scoring Systems
Maybe clearing lines isn't enough. If you clear lines with the same color in them, maybe you collect certain rewards?
  

** Program Tetris on progressively smaller machines
Embedded tetris!

** Different block types
Type U, V, W, X, Y, Z.... etc...
